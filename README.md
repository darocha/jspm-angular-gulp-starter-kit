# jspm-angular-gulp-starter-kit
A simple starter kit for creating Angular 1.x apps using JSPM and Gulp.

## Why?
When I discovered JSPM and System.js I was really excited to get started building single page apps using ES6 modules
and Angular. I found a handful of boilerplate repos that were great, but all had a little too much starter
code. Those projects were pretty confusing and hard to understand all the moving parts. The goal of this project is to
be as simple as possible for people to get started with JSPM and Angular.

## Install

```
npm install -g jspm gulp
git clone git@github.com:ryanirilli/jspm-angular-gulp-starter-kit.git
cd into cloned directory
npm install
jspm install
gulp
open http://localhost:8080 in your browser
```
